**Disclaimer** This project was mostly generated using codex and gpt 5. I'm planning to actually use this and all seems fine so far.
But some people might like to know where this came from. Of course knowing what to ask for helps and I have quite a bit of
experience with the topic of observability. I just did not feel like reinventing this wheel manually was a good idea.
