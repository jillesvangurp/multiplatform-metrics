Kotlin multiplatform metrics registry with simple counters, gauges, timers and summaries. On JVM, you can publish to a micrometer MeterRegistry (like comes with Spring).

Intended to have a more Kotlin native feel to it. Which means DSLs, using durations and building on other stuff in `kotlin.time` package.

**Note** this is a work in progress and the API may evolve.
